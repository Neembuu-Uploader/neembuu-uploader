==== v 3.1.0 ====
* Feature : All successful uploads are written in
  a text file located <userhome>\.neembuuuploader\successfullyUploadedFilesList.txt
  As per user mailseb's request in the NU forums.
* Changed the translation system. Now it is simpler.
  Now java interfaces are mapped to strings, instead of strings to strings.
  This avoids spelling mistakes, and also allows easy checking
  of default values, and also variable usage (using netbeans)
* Long translation strings are automatically broken into 
  one or more lines.
* Fixed bug : ReentrantLock$Sync.tryRelease 
  PoolingClientConnectionManager.leaseConnection
* Created a tool which automatically generates translations for
  untranslated strings using google translate. (My sincere gratitude to Google).
  Machine (Google) translated strings are marked (g).
  (g) means these strings have not been checked by human for sanity.
  Some google translations are total nonsense. We have no clue
  of what google has done. So to let users know, these have been
  marked as (g).
* Translation entirey machine generated for many new languages have 
  been done. In total 67 language translations are hence available.
